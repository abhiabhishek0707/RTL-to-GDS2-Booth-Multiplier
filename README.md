This repository presents the complete design flow of an 8-bit Booth Multiplier using Radix-4 encoding, implemented from RTL (Register Transfer Level) to GDSII (layout level). The design focuses on efficient multiplication with reduced partial products and optimized hardware utilization, making it suitable for high-performance and low-power VLSI systems.

Features

Radix-4 Booth Encoding: Reduces the number of partial products by encoding the multiplier in groups of 2 bits, improving speed and efficiency.

8-bit Multiplier Design: Implements signed multiplication for 8-bit operands with accurate handling of negative numbers using Booth’s algorithm.

Optimized Partial Product Generation: Minimizes the number of addition stages compared to conventional multipliers.

Complete RTL-to-GDSII Flow: Covers the full ASIC design cycle including: RTL design (Verilog) Functional simulation Synthesis Floorplanning Placement & Routing GDSII generation

Area and Power Efficient: Reduction in switching activity and hardware resources due to fewer partial products.

Modular Design: Separate modules for encoder, partial product generator, and adder tree for easy customization and scalability.

Usage: Use the provided RTL modules to simulate and verify multiplier functionality. Modify bit-width or architecture (e.g., extend to 16-bit or higher). Integrate into larger datapath designs such as ALUs, DSP blocks, or MAC units. Run through synthesis and physical design tools to generate final GDSII layout.
